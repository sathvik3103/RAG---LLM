        "2. **Open AI** is a comapny that provides the service to use GPT language models.\n",

        "4. **Tiktoken** is an open-source tool developed by OpenAI that is utilized for tokenizing text. Tokenization is when you split a text string to a list of tokens. Tokens can be letters, words or grouping of words (depending on the text language).\\\n",
        "For example, “I’m playing with AI models” can be transformed to this list \\\n",

For a wide range of strata disputes, you can file an appeal with the Civil Resolution Tribunal (CRT), which offers a quicker and less expensive resolution process that can be done online without the need for a lawyer. However, there may be certain situations where the CRT does not have jurisdiction, and you may need to go to BC Strata Council.\n",

            "8. If you need help finding a lawyer, you can reach out to the Lawyer Referral Service for a complimentary 15-minute consultation to see if you want to hire them. Alternatively, you can search for a lawyer in the BC Legal Directory by community or legal issue.\n"

But it may be worth the investment to know how to best respond to a complaint. You can try to keep the scope of your lawyer’s work narrow. Tell them exactly what you do and don’t want help with. This is called unbundling, and can save you quite a bit of money in legal fees. At the very least, you may be able to consult with a lawyer for a nominal consult fee and they can give you information and options to handle the issue.\n",
